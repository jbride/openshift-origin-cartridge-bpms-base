* we've discussed the existence of a series of bpm base and add-on cartridges

* for those that might be interested in creating cartridge themselves for any functionality, might be wondering at this point how to even get started:

* recommend a local, controlled OSE 1.2 environment that is light-weight and reproducible
** local
*** root causes of most errors encountered during OSE dev don't get propogated up to the RHC client 
*** instead, tail mcollective.log on target node to view root causes
*** mcollective.log is not viewable by users of Openshift Online
** reproducible
*** allow for lots of mistakes and ability roll-back to known working snapshots

* rhelRepo
** bring it up every couple of weeks
** using reposync, pull down latest packages from rhel6, ose and jboss channels
** now that latest packages are local:  can quickly update my existing OSE development nodes or provision new OSE dev environments entirely
